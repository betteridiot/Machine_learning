Interactive plots and code base for accelerometer classification can be found [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/betteridiot/Machine_learning/blob/c4d1c79c421fa54feb984fe9fa3ad48f9a7a2811/Gradient%20v2.ipynb).<br><br>
Gradient_v2.ipynb is the raw notebook file (cannot be visualized unless using nbviewer or on native computer with plotly installed)
<br><br>
